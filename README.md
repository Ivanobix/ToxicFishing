# 🎣 ToxicFishing: Your Virtual Fishing Assistant in World of Warcraft 🎮

Welcome to **ToxicFishing**, the virtual assistant designed to revolutionize your fishing experience in World of Warcraft. If you're looking for a way to automate the fishing process, you're in the right place!

## 🌟 What is ToxicFishing?

ToxicFishing is an automation tool that enhances and simplifies the fishing process in World of Warcraft. Imagine having a virtual companion taking care of fishing for you, using baits, and even looting bound items, all while you relax. That's ToxicFishing!

## 🛡 Safety and Discretion

ToxicFishing has been designed with utmost discretion in mind:
- **Undetectable**: It doesn't use DLL injection techniques or similar methods that can be detected by the game's security systems.
- **Random Actions**: The actions it performs are at random times, meaning there are no detectable patterns that can be identified by detection mechanisms.

## 🎣 How does it work?

1. **Float Detection**: Using advanced techniques, ToxicFishing "watches" your game screen to locate your float. Once identified, it tracks its movement to detect any activity.

2. **Bite Waiting**: Just like in real fishing, the float will sink or move when a fish bites. ToxicFishing is always alert to these movements.

3. **Automatic Capture**: The moment it detects a fish has bitten, ToxicFishing acts quickly to secure your catch.

4. **Smart Repetition**: After each catch, it prepares and casts the rod again, ensuring beforehand the need to use a new bait.

## 🎮 Setup and Use

To get the most out of ToxicFishing, follow these steps:

1. **Preparations in World of Warcraft**:  
    1. Before using ToxicFishing, make sure you have auto-loot enabled in the game options.
    2. The fishing action should be assigned to number `4`, baits on `5`, and on `6` there should be a macro with the code: `"/click StaticPopup1Button1"`.
    3. Ensure you are in a fishing zone with your rod equipped.
    4. Float detection is done by detecting the red feather, so on your screen, there should be no red-colored elements and the float should be in the central region of your main monitor.

2. **Running ToxicFishing**: With everything set up in the game, start ToxicFishing.

3. **Watch and Relax**: Now, simply watch as your character fishes automatically and efficiently.

4. **Completion**: When you feel you've fished enough, close ToxicFishing and continue your adventure in World of Warcraft.
